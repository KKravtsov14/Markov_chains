In the middle of the street stood a stroller, dandyish and noble, harnessed by a pair of hot gray horses; there were no riders, and the coachman himself, having fallen off a goat, stood beside him; horses were kept under the bridle. A lot of people crowded around, in front of all the police. One of them had a lit flashlight in his hands, with which he, bending down, lit something on the pavement, at the very wheels. Everyone spoke, shouted, gasped; the coachman seemed perplexed and occasionally repeated:
- What a sin! Lord, what a sin!
Raskolnikov pushed himself as far as possible, and finally saw the subject of all this fuss and curiosity. A man just crushed by horses was lying on the ground, apparently without feelings, very thinly dressed, but in a "noble" dress, all covered in blood. Blood flowed from the face, from the head; his face was all beaten, tattered, and distorted. It was evident that crushed in earnest.
- Fathers! - the coachman wailed, - how to see here! If I had driven, or if I hadn’t shouted to him, otherwise I would not drive hastily, evenly. Everyone saw: people are a lie, and then I am. He doesn’t put a candle in it - it’s known! .. I see him, he crosses the street, staggers, almost falls, - he shouted once, yes, in the other, and in the third, and he kept the horses; and he directly fell under their feet and fell! It was on purpose that he, al, was already very nonsense ... The horses, young, shy, pulled, and he cried out - they are more ... that’s the trouble.
- It is as it is! - Someone heard a testimonial in the crowd.
“He shouted, it’s true, he shouted three times to him,” another voice said.
- In Akurat three times, everyone heard! Shouted the third.
However, the coachman was not very dull and scared. It was evident that the crew belonged to a wealthy and significant owner who was awaiting his arrival somewhere; the police, of course, cared a lot about how to settle this last circumstance. The crushed person was to be tidied up to the unit and to the hospital. No one knew his name.
Meanwhile, Raskolnikov was squeezed and bent even closer. Suddenly a flashlight brightly illuminated the face of the unfortunate; he recognized him.
- I know him, I know! He cried, squeezing all the way forward, “this is an official, retired, titular adviser, Marmeladov!” He lives here, beside him, in the house of Cose-la ... Doctors soon! I will pay, lo! - He pulled money from his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in amazing excitement.
The police were pleased to find out who was crushed. Raskolnikov also called himself, gave his address and with all his might, as if it was a matter of his own father, persuaded to transfer as soon as possible the insensitive Marmeladov to his apartment.
“Here, through three houses,” he fussed, “the house of Kozel, a German, rich ... He now, drunk indeed, was making his way home.” I know him ... He is a drunkard ... He has a family there, a wife, children, one daughter. It’s still dragging me to the hospital, but here, right, there’s a doctor in the house! I’ll cry, I’ll cry! .. Still, they will have their own care, they will help now, otherwise he will die before the hospital ...
He even managed to stick it inconspicuously into his hand; the matter, however, was clear and lawful, and in any case, help was closer here. The crushed one was picked up and carried; helpers were found. Kozel’s house was thirty steps away. Raskolnikov walked behind, carefully supported his head and showed the way.
- Here, here! On the stairs it is necessary to bring upside down; wrap ... like that! I will pay, I will thank, ”he muttered.
Katerina Ivanovna, as always, as soon as she had a free minute, immediately began to walk back and forth through her small room, from the window to the stove and back, her arms crossed tightly, speaking to herself and coughing. Recently, she began to talk more and more often with her older girl, ten-year-old Polenka, who, although she still didn’t understand much, but she understood very well what her mother needed, and therefore she always watched her with her big clever eyes and all sorts of tricks to introduce myself as understanding. This time, Polenka undressed his little brother, who was unwell all day to put him to bed. Waiting for him to change his shirt, which was to be washed at night, the boy sat in the chair silently, with a serious mine, directly and motionless, with legs extended forward, tightly clasped together, heels to the audience, and socks apart. He listened to what mother and sister were talking about, pouting lips, bulging eyes and not moving, just like all smart boys should normally sit when they are stripped to go to sleep. Even less, his girl, in perfect rags, stood by the screens and waited her turn. The door to the staircase was opened to protect at least from the waves of tobacco smoke bursting from other rooms and constantly making the poor consumptive cough long and painfully. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have lost even more weight this week, and the red spots on her cheeks burned even brighter than before.
“You won’t believe it, you cannot even imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking around the room, “to what extent we lived happily and luxuriantly in my dad’s house and how this drunkard killed me and will destroy all of you!” Dad was a state colonel and already almost a governor; he only had one step left, so
